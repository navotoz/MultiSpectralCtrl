    "# Jitter issues\n",
    "After closely inspecting panchromatic (as well as filtered) pixels along consequent frames, there seems to be some weired inconsistent trend (jitter) in the obtained grey levels. The dynamic range of the jitter can be as high as 400 Grey levels, which are equivilent to 5-6 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The jitter issue is problematic since it affects the quality of the camera's modeling and calibration, and since an acquisition of a static scene can result in significant unpredictable bias differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different configurations of the camera produced different jitter over time.\n",
    "Two main parameters were set:\n",
    "- Flat Field Correction (FFC). This is a calibration process of the camera, where the shutter is closed momenterilly (~0.4 seconds) and an offset value for each pixel is updated from a lookup table, using the internal camera temperature (FPA and Housing temperatures). The FFC can be either performed once in the begining of the measure, or every preset number of frames (e.g, every one minute).\n",
    "- Temperature linear grey levels (Tlinear in short). When active (tlinear1) the grey levels are transformed by the camera such that:\n",
    "    0.04 * GL - 273.15 is the targets temperature (as estimated by the camera). \n",
    "    When inactive (tlinear0), the GL represent the radiation flux on the bolometer array.\n",
